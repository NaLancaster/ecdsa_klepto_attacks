# ecdsa_klepto_attacks
This repository contains source code for two kleptographic attacks on the ECDSA signature scheme. The first is based on the synthetic generation of the ephemeral randomness.
Whereas, the second attack performs rejection sampling to leak one bit per signature.
This source code in this repository is intended for pure acadmic purposes.
